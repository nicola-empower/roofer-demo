 create a **"Generic Contact Page"** template that works for all of them? I can write a script for the "form success" message that reinforces the premium feel (e.g., *"Your request has been priority routed to our dispatch team"*).


 This is the secret sauce. To justify the £3k–£5k price tag, the client needs to feel like you built this *just for them*, even if the underlying code structure (React/Astro components) is shared.

You can break the "template" feel by creating **3 distinct Design Systems** using Tailwind. Assign each trade to one of these systems.

Here is a breakdown of how to style them using specific Typography, Color Palettes, and Border Radiuses to match the Copy Personas we just built.

### 1\. The "Heritage & Luxury" System

**Used for:** Joiner (Oak & Chisel), Landscaper (Eden), Roofer (Summit).
**The Vibe:** Old money, craftsmanship, organic, established.

  * **Typography:** Pair a classy Serif header with a clean Sans body.
      * *Headers:* `font-serif` (e.g., "Playfair Display" or "Merriweather").
      * *Body:* `font-sans` (e.g., "Lato" or "Source Sans Pro").
  * **Tailwind Config (The Look):**
      * **Rounded Corners:** Soft and approachable. Use `rounded-md` or `rounded-lg`.
      * **Buttons:** Subtle aesthetics. `border border-current` (ghost buttons) or solid colors with `shadow-sm`.
      * **Colors:** Earth tones.
          * *Joiner:* `bg-stone-50` (background), `text-stone-900` (text), `bg-amber-800` (buttons/accents).
          * *Landscaper:* `bg-white`, `text-slate-800`, `bg-emerald-700` (buttons).
  * **Key CSS Class to use:** `tracking-wide` (letter spacing) on the headers creates an instant "luxury" feel.

### 2\. The "Technical & Urgent" System

**Used for:** Electrician (Volt Master), Locksmith (Secure), Heating (Therma Heat).
**The Vibe:** High-tech, fast, precise, safety-critical.

  * **Typography:** Modern, geometric, or mono-spaced.
      * *Headers:* `font-sans` (e.g., "Inter", "Roboto", or "Oswald" for urgency).
      * *Sub-headers:* `font-mono` (e.g., "JetBrains Mono" or "Roboto Mono") for small details like "24/7" or phone numbers.
  * **Tailwind Config (The Look):**
      * **Rounded Corners:** Sharp and industrial. Use `rounded-none` or very tight `rounded-sm`.
      * **Buttons:** High contrast, loud. `uppercase`, `font-bold`, `tracking-wider`.
      * **Colors:** High contrast / Dark Mode.
          * *Electrician:* **Dark Mode.** `bg-slate-950`, `text-white`, `text-cyan-400` (accents).
          * *Locksmith:* `bg-gray-900`, `text-gray-100`, `bg-red-600` (urgent buttons).
          * *Heating:* `bg-white`, `text-slate-900`, `bg-orange-500` (warmth).
  * **Key CSS Class to use:** `backdrop-blur-md` on navigation bars or quote forms to make it feel like "modern tech."

### 3\. The "Clean & Corporate" System

**Used for:** Cleaner (Pristine), Plumber (Elite), Builder (Apex).
**The Vibe:** Trustworthy, hygienic, professional, scalable.

  * **Typography:** Very clean, neutral Sans-Serif.
      * *Headers & Body:* `font-sans` (e.g., "Montserrat" or "Open Sans"). Avoid quirks.
  * **Tailwind Config (The Look):**
      * **Rounded Corners:** Friendly but professional. `rounded` or `rounded-md`.
      * **Layout:** High whitespace (`gap-8`, `p-12`). Don't crowd the elements.
      * **Shadows:** Use `shadow-lg` or `shadow-xl` on cards to make them "float" (feels premium).
      * **Colors:** "Medical" or "Corporate" cleanliness.
          * *Cleaner:* `bg-sky-50` (very light blue), `text-slate-600`, `bg-teal-500` (buttons).
          * *Plumber:* `bg-white`, `text-slate-800`, `bg-blue-600` (trust).
  * **Key CSS Class to use:** `divide-y` and `divide-gray-100` to create clean separation between sections without heavy borders.

### Quick "Cheat Sheet" for your `tailwind.config.js`

You can actually set these up as presets. Here is a quick reference on how to style the **Hero Button** for each to make them feel totally different:

**1. The Joiner (Heritage):**

```html
<button class="bg-amber-800 text-stone-50 font-serif px-8 py-3 rounded-md shadow-sm hover:bg-amber-900 transition-colors">
  Request Commission
</button>
```

**2. The Electrician (Tech/Dark):**

```html
<button class="bg-cyan-500 text-slate-900 font-bold uppercase tracking-widest px-6 py-3 rounded-none hover:bg-cyan-400 hover:shadow-[0_0_15px_rgba(6,182,212,0.5)] transition-all">
  Get Quote
</button>
```

*(Note: That `hover:shadow` adds a "glowing" neon effect).*

**3. The Cleaner (Corporate):**

```html
<button class="bg-teal-600 text-white font-sans font-semibold px-8 py-3 rounded-full shadow-lg hover:shadow-xl hover:-translate-y-0.5 transition-all">
  Book Deep Clean
</button>
```

*(Note: `rounded-full` gives a very friendly, "bubble" feel appropriate for cleaning).*

### Implementation in Tailwind

To make this easy, just update your `tailwind.config.js` for the specific project you are working on.

**Example for the Joiner (Heritage):**

```javascript
// tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  theme: {
    extend: {
      fontFamily: {
        // Assign Libre Baskerville to 'serif' or a custom name like 'header'
        header: ['"Libre Baskerville"', 'serif'],
        // Assign Source Sans Pro to 'body'
        body: ['"Source Sans Pro"', 'sans-serif'],
      },
    },
  },
}
```

Then in your HTML/React:

```html
<h1 class="font-header text-4xl text-stone-900">Bespoke Joinery</h1>
<p class="font-body text-stone-600">Handcrafted in our local workshop.</p>
```
