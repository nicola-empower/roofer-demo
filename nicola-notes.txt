This is the final piece of the puzzle: **Summit Roofing**.

The video shows a site that screams "Heritage" and "Quality." The layout is heavy, solid, and trustworthy.

To sell this to a roofer for £3k–£5k, you need to address their biggest pain point: **Trust.** Homeowners are terrified of roofers (the "cowboy" stereotype). This website needs to look like a fortress of reliability. It needs to say: *"We are expensive because we do it right the first time."*

### The Persona: "The Structural Guardian"
* **Tone:** Solid, permanent, authoritative.
* **The Pitch:** Your roof protects your entire investment. Don't gamble with it.
* **Target Audience:** Owners of period properties in Leeds/Yorkshire who need slate restoration, or modern homeowners needing high-tech flat roofing.

Here is the homepage copy for **Summit Roofing**.

### 1. Hero Section (The Shield)
*The current copy is actually very strong. Let's tweak it slightly to emphasize longevity.*

**Headline:**
**Superior Protection Above Everything Else.**

**Sub-headline:**
From heritage slate restorations to modern flat rubber roofing. We ensure your home is weatherproof, beautiful, and secure for decades to come.

**The Stats Bar (The "Anti-Cowboy" Signals):**
* **10-Year Insurance Guarantee:** We back every single job.
* **NFRC Certified:** Fully vetted members of the National Federation of Roofing Contractors.
* **24h Storm Response:** When the weather hits, we hit back.

### 2. Services Section (Old Skills & New Tech)
*Roofing is split between "making it look nice" (Slate) and "stopping the water" (Flat).*

**Headline:**
**Protection Meets Design**

* **Heritage Slate & Tiling:**
    We specialize in sourcing reclaimed slate to match period properties perfectly. Our lead-work and detailing respect the history of your building.
* **Modern Flat Roofing (EPDM/GRP):**
    Forget bubbling felt. We install seamless rubber (EPDM) and fiberglass systems that come with 20-year manufacturer warranties. Ideal for extensions and garages.
* **Storm Damage & Rapid Repairs:**
    Loose tiles? Leaking valleys? We deploy quickly to secure your property and prevent water ingress from ruining your ceilings.

### 3. The "Tech" Hook: The Drone Inspection
*This is the **MVP** feature for selling this site. Roofers hate setting up ladders just to give a quote. This sells the idea of a "Digital Survey."*

**Headline:**
**See Your Roof Like Never Before**

**Body:**
Why guess what the problem is? We use 4K Drone Technology to survey your roof safely and quickly.
* **Zero Risk:** No ladders or scaffolding needed for the quote.
* **Visual Proof:** You receive a full digital report with high-res photos showing exactly where the damage is.
* **Transparent Pricing:** You see what we see. No made-up problems.

*(Pitching tip: Tell the roofer: "This 'Drone Survey' page allows you to charge £150 for an inspection, which you refund if they book the job. It filters out tire-kickers.")*

### 4. The "Why Choose Us" (Urgency)
*The video uses the header "A Leaking Roof Damages Your Entire Home". This is perfect fear-based marketing.*

**Headline:**
**A Small Leak is a Big Problem**

**Body:**
Water ingress doesn't just stain your ceiling; it rots timber and destroys insulation. We don't patch over cracks; we solve the root cause.
* **Photo Evidence:** We take "Before" and "After" photos of every repair.
* **Fixed Quotes:** No "escalating costs" once we are up the ladder.
* **Site Cleanliness:** We sweep your gutters and remove all debris before we leave.

### 5. Testimonials (Heritage & Reliability)
*We need to prove they can handle the expensive jobs.*
